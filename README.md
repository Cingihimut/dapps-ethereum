<h1 align="center" id="title">E-voting with ethereum blockchain</h1>

<p id="description">Welcome to this repository dedicated to the development of a voting website using Ethereum! This project integrates both the Ethereum smart contract development (found in the eth-contract folder) and the frontend application (located in the front-end folder). The development stack includes JavaScript, the Next.js framework, and the Web3.js library for seamless interaction with Ethereum smart contracts.</p>

## Project Structure
📂Ethereum Smart Contracts (`eth-contract` Folder)
- The `eth-contract` folder contains the Ethereum smart contracts responsible for managing the voting logic.
- Ensure you have the necessary development environment set up to deploy and interact with Ethereum smart contracts.

📂Frontend Application (`front-end` Folder)
- The `front-end` folder hosts the Next.js frontend application for the voting website.
- This application utilizes JavaScript, Next.js, and Web3.js for smooth communication with Ethereum smart contracts.
- Ensure you have Node.js and npm installed to run the frontend application.
